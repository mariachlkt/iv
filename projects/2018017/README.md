### Introduction
#### Synopsis
Initially, we would think of computers as mediums; Tools that are configured to perform specific tasks (i.e. sequential mathematical calculations) in a timely manner and do them well. With the advent of technology, the need to understand the ever-increasing information that became universally available would set out the requirements for a method that filters information in order to extract valuable data. In turn and upon human interaction, this data, once identified, would potentially lead to the salient features/conclusions of the examined information.
The most prevalent process of conceptualizing and understanding information is through visualization (known as 'Information Visualization'). Principally, visualization serves to tear down information in a coherent way for the creators and/or recipients to engage in conversation in order to better understand what is it that is analyzed.
