### Introduction
#### Synopsis
Initially, we would think of computers as mediums; Tools that are configured to perform specific tasks (i.e. sequential mathematical calculations) in a timely manner and do them well. With the advent of technology, the need to understand the ever-increasing information that became universally available would set out the requirements for a method that filters information in order to extract valuable data. In turn and upon human interaction, this data, once identified, would potentially lead to the salient features/conclusions of the examined information.
The most prevalent process of conceptualizing and understanding information is through visualization (known as 'Information Visualization'). Principally, visualization serves to tear down information in a coherent way for the creators and/or recipients to engage in conversation in order to better understand what is it that is analyzed.
#### Goals
Quite often, there is a mutual correlation between Data Visualization and Information Visualization in the sense that mere data analysis does not explicitly warrant that the conclusions are understood by the average recipient and/or other third parties.<br>
For example, one data scientist, skilled at creating data visualization, might lack the skills needed to effectively communicate the salient features of a data set, once those have been identified. On the contrary, one skilled designer of information visualization might lack the skills required to handle a large data set, extract the data samples, perform statistical analysis and determine the data setâ€™s important characteristics and patterns.<br>
In that regard and as far as the course is concerned, a few personal pursuits are set:
* To determine which procedures constitute Information Visualization and which Data Visualization
* To follow basic a set of rules for how to communicate intent and identity, how to persuade as well as to inform
* To identify significant characteristics and patterns of a given data set
* To examine visual representation techniques that may have left a negative impact in the past
* To understand which visualization tools are most appropriate for a given {procedure, data set}
